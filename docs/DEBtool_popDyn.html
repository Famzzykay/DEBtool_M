      <h1>DEBtool Toolbox: popDyn</h1>

      A collection of functions that computes population trajectories of individuals.
      The step from individuals to populations can be made in several ways, each with their own weak and strong poperties,
      as discussed at the <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/popDyn/popDyn.html" target="_blank">popDyn page</a>.

      <h2><a name="constant">Constant environments</a></h2>
      If a homogenous environment remains constant in terms of food and temperature, the population will eventually grow exponentially
      at a rate that follows from the chacteristic equation.
      This equation determines this rate implicitly only, and the specific population growth rate needs to be obtained numerically from this equation.

      <p>
      Function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/sgr_mod.html" target="_blank"><b>sgr_mod</b></a>,
      standing for "specific (population) growth rate", solves the characteristic equation for all the DEB models.
      This growth rate depends on temperature and food availability.
      Function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/f_ris0_mod.html" target="_blank"><b>f_ris0_mod</b></a>
      finds the scaled functional response (f) for which the specific population growth rate is zero (ris0), again for all DEB models.
      Function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/ssd_mod.html" target="_blank"><b>ssd_mod</b></a> computes a number of population characteristics:
      The mean length, squared length, cubed length and wet weight of the individuals in the population, if at pseudo steady state (meaning that the stable age distribution is reached).
      On top of that, a large number of other population characteristics is computed, as described for the standard DEB model
      <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/ssd_std.html" target="_blank"><b>ssd_std</b></a>.
